# Streaming Voice activated Search Agent using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)

With this quickstart, you'll learn to create a simple agent and use ADK Streaming to enable voice and video communication with it that is low-latency and bidirectional. We will install ADK, set up a basic "Google Search" agent, try running the agent with Streaming with adk web tool, and then explain how to build a simple asynchronous web app by yourself using ADK Streaming and FastAPI.

This code follows the [official Google doc](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/streaming/quickstart-streaming/)
