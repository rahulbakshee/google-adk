# 🤖 Agent Development Kit (ADK) by Google
Welcome to my experiments with Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) — a framework designed to build robust, modular, and intelligent AI agents with ease. This repository explores various capabilities of ADK and showcases sample implementations, components, Agents, and workflows.

# 🌟 What is ADK?
The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source framework from Google that simplifies the development of autonomous AI agents. It provides the infrastructure to build modular, composable, and reactive agents that can plan, reason, and act across a variety of tools and environments.

Think of it as a way to orchestrate complex AI behavior using structured, reusable components—ideal for research, production, and LLM-based automation.

🔁 Event-driven agent loop

🧩 Composable components (tools, memory, state, etc.)

🗺️ Built-in support for planning and tool usage

⚙️ Easily extensible for custom logic and tools

Official docs: https://google.github.io/adk-docs

# 🛠️ Key Features
 - Multi-step planning and reasoning

 - Tool and environment integration

 - Structured agent workflows

 - LLM-agnostic architecture (can plug in models like Gemini, OpenAI, etc.)

 - Support for memory, world models, reactive triggers

# 🚀 Use Cases
Here are some potential use cases where ADK shines:

1. AutoDev Agents
Automate software development workflows: coding, testing, debugging, PR generation, etc.

2. Customer Support Agents
Build agents capable of searching documentation, summarizing responses, escalating issues, and automating actions.

3. Research Assistants
Develop agents that can search papers, summarize findings, generate citations, or propose experiments.

4. Workflow Automation
Use ADK to build AI agents that monitor events (emails, Slack, etc.) and respond or take actions using integrated tools.

5. Multi-agent Collaboration
Architect a team of cooperative agents performing distinct tasks with shared goals and memory.
